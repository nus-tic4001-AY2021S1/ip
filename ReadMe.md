![Ui](./docs/Ui.png)

Duke is a Java-based desktop app that helps the users keep track of the tasks they need to do. It comes with a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to enter their commands while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This allows users who type fast to complete their desired actions quicker than using traditional GUI apps.

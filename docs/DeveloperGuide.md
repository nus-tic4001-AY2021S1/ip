## **Design**
### Architecture
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**]: The UI of the App.
* [**`Util`**]: (Storage) Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk. (Tasklist) Contains multiple tasks.
* [**`Command`**]: Handles various commands.
* [**`Tasks`**]: Holds the tasks related records such as todo, event, deadline.
* [**`Exceptions`**]: The exception executor.
* [**`Parser`**]: The parser executor.

## **Appendix: Requirements**
### Product scope

**Target user profile**: This app is targeted towards any user who wish to keep track of tasks.

**Value proposition**: This app shall allow users to manage tasks to track their progress.
This helps them to manage their tasks and make timely adjustments to their habits when necessary.

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a …​                                    | I want to …​                                | So that I can…​                                             |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `* * *`  | user    | add a todo task record               | keep track of a particular todo task                        |
| `* * *`  | user    | add a event task record               | keep track of a particular event task                        |
| `* * *`  | user    | add a deadline task record             | keep track of a particular deadline task                        |
|`* * *`   | user    |list my tasks                         |view all my tasks|
|`* * *`   | user    |clear all my tasks                         |start afresh with the app|
| `* * *`  | user    | delete a task record                      | remove a task record that I no longer need                        |
| `* * *`  | user     | find a task record                  | look at the particular task's information                          |
| `* * *`  | user     | sort task records by task status, task description | see task in a proper sequence                         |
| `* * *`  | user     | mark task records as done | label tasks which have been completed                         |



### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The app should work on any mainstream OS with Java `11` or above installed.
2. The response time for each command should not exceed `3` seconds.
3. A user with average typing speed should be able to enter any one command within `12` seconds.
4. After using each command for at least `5` times, a user with no cognitive disability should be able to
   use all the app features without having to reference the user guide.


### Glossary

* *Mainstream OS* - Windows 7, Windows 10, Linux, Unix, OS-X

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.



### Deleting a task

1. Deleting a task while all tasks are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all tasks using the `list` command. Multiple tasks in the list.

    1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First task is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted task shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No task is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.


### Finding a task
1. Finding a task based on the key information
    1. Prerequisites: There shall be some tasks in the lists so that the system can return some results.
    1. Test case: `find <KEYWORD>`<br>
      Expected: The tasks contain the specific keyword will be found and shown to the user.


### Adding a task
1. Adding different kinds of tasks such as todo, deadline, event task
1. Using the command as followings:
    1. Adds a Todo task. ToDos: tasks without any date/time attached to it `e.g., visit new theme park`. <br>
       Format: `todo` **TASK DESCRIPTIONS**
    1. Adds a Deadline task. Deadlines: tasks that need to be done before a specific date `e.g., submit report by 2020-10-23` <br>
       Format: `deadline` **TASK DESCRIPTIONS** `/by` **SPECIFIC DATE** (FORMAT:yyyy-MM-dd)
    1. Adds an Event task. Events: tasks that start at a specific time and ends at a specific time `e.g., team project meeting at 2020-10-23 10:00`<br>
       Format: `event` **TASK DESCRIPTIONS** `/at` **SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME** (FORMAT:yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm)

## Design

### Architecture

![Image of ArchitectureDiagram](https://github.com/HongJiancheng/ip/blob/master/docs/images/architecture.png?raw=true)
The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The rest of the App consists of seven components.

UI: The UI of the App.
Duke: The main logic handler of the App.
Launcher: The handler between UI and Duke.
Commons: The control variable of the App.
Storage: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
Commands: The actions of the program to interact with Storage.
TaskList: Define the structure of each Task to track.


### How the architecture components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user uses the Event command.

### Storage component

![Image of Storage Class Diagram](https://github.com/HongJiancheng/ip/blob/master/docs/images/class%20diagram.png?raw=true)

The Storage component is the handler of the temporary storage to storage file. It interacts TaskList Class which contains Task Class, and Task Class have many Subclasses for different scenarios.

It will auto save the program into a .txt file once a change has been made to the TaskList.

## Implementation

Duplicate Implementation

The ```duplicate``` feature displays non-unique Tasks in the Duke. It is achieved by the DuplicateCommand Class which made use of isEquals method in Task Class.

##### Design consideration:
Aspect: Duplicate can otherwise be implemented

###### Alternative 1 (current choice): Allow user to obtain results in the index ascending order.
Pros: Easy to implement. <br>
Cons: If there is a huge amount of return result, it may be difficult for user to view.

###### Alternative 2: Allow user to view part of the result.
Pros: More readable result to user if there is huge return data.<br>
Cons: more difficult to implement.

## Product scope
### Target user profile
* Is a lay person who used to interact with chat-bot.
* prefer desktop apps over other types.
* can type fast.
* prefers typing to mouse interactions.


### Value proposition
manage Tasks faster than a typical mouse driven app. Allows the user to better manage the tasks.

## User Stories

|Priority| As a … | I want to … | So that I can… |
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|* * * |New user|add tasks into Task Manager|track my pending Tasks|
|* * * |New user|list all tasks stored in the Task Manager|find all the recorded tasks|
|* * * |New user|delete a task|remove Task that is irrelevant|
|* * * |New user|set a task as done|to track the progression of the Task Manager|
|* * * |New user|add a task with deadline|remind myself about the remaining time|
|* * * |New user|add a future task with start date|remind myself to prepare for it|
|* * * |User|find tasks with key word|find specific task easily|
|* * * |User|have a help guide|view the usage of the app|
|* * * |User|check duplicate tasks in the Task Manager|those repeated tasks could be delete|


## Non-Functional Requirements

* Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
* Should be able to hold up to 1000 tasks without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
* A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse
* Should load from and save to from a text files


## Glossary

* *Mainstream OS:* Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.
